        I attended San Francisco Art Institute's PreCollege program in the summer of 2017. For four weeks, I took the local CalTrain and biked a total of 15 miles
        a day in order to go to my daily classes. I was fortunate enough to be able to take two painting college-level courses throughout the month in addition
        to attending workshops and studio hours to further develop my skills as an artist.
        <br>

        My morning class, "Painting and Permutations", was more experimental than I had expected. In the class, we discussed various contemporary artworks and styles,
        mainly focusing on abstract and surreal art. Thus, I began to explore different art styles and dabbled in impressionism, moving away from the realistic style I
        usually paint with.
        <br>
        <br>
        Below is my final exhibit of my artworks from the class. The two landscapes were made using only a palette knife, adding to a more messy and impressionist feel.
        On the right, the portrait of my mother was also an attempt at a less realistic painting. I made my brushstrokes more apparent and less hidden, creating a Fauvist
        style of art that I previously had not used.

        In the afternoon, I attended a class called "Narrative and Identity in Painting", taught by Caitlin Mitchell-Dayton. This class focused more on larger pieces and
        incorporated narratives and self-expression in the painting. Many of my classmates, including myself, opted for self-portraits done on giant canvases. Caitlin
        was incredibly supportive as I was painting and gave me invaluable input during my process. I am incredibly proud of my final piece and recognize that it was a
        huge success. My painting was 36" x 48" and took me the entire four weeks to complete. I wanted to express an emotion that many people my age can relate to: the stress
        and pressure of looming college applications. However, I deviated greatly from my traditional choice in color palette, opting for bright oranges, pinks, and purples instead
        of the gloomy ultramarine blues I usually use. This definitely made my piece more interesting.
